# Hexapod Walking Gait - Genetic Algorithms (GA)

## 4th Year Honours Project ##

Optimisation of a hexapod walking gait using genetic algorithms. A URDF file which describes the dimensions and joints of the robot is loaded into the physics environment.

## Libraries ##
This project uses the PyBullet physics engine as the simulation environment and the Bezier library to create foot-tip arc paths for the legs. 
It also requires Numpy, Time and Math libraries, but I'll assume you have them installed already.
```
pip install pybullet
pip install bezier
```
