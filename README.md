# Hexapod Walking Gait - Genetic Algorithms (GA)

## 4th Year Honours Project ##

Optimisation of a hexapod walking gait using genetic algorithms. An URDF file which describes the dimensions and joints of the robot is loaded into the physics environment.

## Libraries ##
Project uses PyBullet physics engine as simulation environment and Bezier library to create arc paths for legs. 
Requires Numpy, Time and Math libraries, but I'll assume you have them installed already.
```
pip install pybullet
pip install bezier
```
